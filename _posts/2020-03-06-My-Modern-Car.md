## My Modern Car

#### The Story

> After lunch my friend and I paid the bill and made our way to my car. I took out my remote-control gadget and pressed the button which automatically unlocks the doors.
Not having noticed what I did, my friend looked puzzled and asked, "What was that clicking sound?"
"It was just the doors unlocking," I answered.
He looked at me with astonishment and said, "The car recognizes you?!"
