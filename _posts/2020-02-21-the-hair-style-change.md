A different hairstyle or color can change a person's entire look. It can make a person look better or worse. Jean was about to enter her first day of college. She wanted a new look. Her current hairstyle was nice, but it was boring. She had it since she was a 9th grader. 


Her hair right now was straight, long, and blonde. She went into the hair salon and asked the hairstylist. "What kind of look are you going for?" the hairstylist asked. "I want to look like a model," Jean said. "Well, we can add layers to your hair. We can also make your hair more blonde," the hairstylist said. "That sounds good!" Jean said. Jean sat in the chair while the hairstylist cut her hair. 


Jean couldn't see herself in the mirror because she didn't have her glasses on. She just trusted the hairstylist. An hour later, the hairstylist said, "Done!" Jean put on her glasses and looked at herself. She looked totally different! She liked it, but felt strange. 


She could barely even recognize herself. Jean asked her friends and family what they thought. Most of them liked it. They said it made her look edgier but very different. In fact, when she met up with her friends, they asked who she was. One of them even tried calling the police when Jean showed up in front of her house.


When Jean was shopping with her friends at the mall, a model scout came up to her and asked if she would consider modeling. Jean said she would think about it and took his business card. The new hairstyle was really working out for her.
