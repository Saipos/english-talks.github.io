## Reading 

Kelly's favorite holiday is Halloween. She loved pumpkin pie, pumpkin spice latte, dressing up, scary movies, and trick-or-treating. The sad thing, however, is that Kelly knows that she is too old for trick-or-treating. She is now 21 years old. She loved how she could get different kinds of candy for free.
 
This Halloween, Kelly was going to babysit her 10 year-old cousin Albert and his friends. Kelly dressed up as a pirate. Her cousin and his friends dressed as ghosts. Albert and his friends made Halloween themed cupcakes. The frosting was orange and the sprinkles on top were black. Afterwards, they carved pumpkins. Albert asked, "What should we do now, Kelly?" "Why don't you go trick-or-treating?" she suggested. "I'm too scared to talk to strangers," Albert said. "Don't worry, I will go with you!" Kelly said.

All of them went to the house to the right. They knocked on the door and said "Trick-or-treat!" The couple smiled and gave the kids a chocolate bar. Kelly wished they gave her one. They went to the next house and the family there gave them gummy worms. The next house they went to was interesting. The couple there gave them money! Kelly definitely wanted some money.

They went to a total of 10 houses and got more than 10 different types of candy. They all went back to Kelly's house. Kelly was sad looking at all their candy. Then, Albert and his friends gave Kelly a hug and said they loved hanging out with her.
